* installation of solaris os
Solaris OS installation begins by booting from the installation media, such as a DVD or USB drive. The system prompts the user to select language, keyboard layout, and installation type (text or graphical). Next, users configure disk partitions and specify the target disk for Solaris installation. Network settings, time zone, and user accounts are then set up. Once configurations are complete, the installation proceeds, and the system reboots into the newly installed Solaris OS.







* system call sigsuspend()
  System calls in Solaris OS are interfaces that allow user-level applications to request services from the kernel. These calls handle operations such as file manipulation, process control, memory management, and interprocess communication. Solaris uses a well-defined set of system call APIs, many of which are compliant with UNIX and POSIX standards. When a system call is made, the CPU switches from user mode to kernel mode to execute the requested operation securely. After completing the operation, control returns to the user application with the result or an error code.
